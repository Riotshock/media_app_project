## Project X
## An app that saves all the anime, manga, TV shows, etc. in a list and has links linking the user to the media.
### Inspired by a friend who kept wishing for an easier way to know what Korean dramas she needs to watch. There aren't really anything that help so why not develop an application that allows her to enter the title and save it on the go? Even if the show isn't found in our database, we can still add it to the list.  
<dl><dt> Includes:</dt>
<dd>User inputs title (autofill like Google's) that will be saved onto a user list.<dd>
<dd>May or may not include a mandatory account.</dd>
<dd>User can develop multiple lists</dd>
<dd>User may share lists. Will have private/public</dd>
<dd>List with like/dislike?</dd>
<dd>Includes manga, anime, TV shows, Korean Dramas(For the friend), movies,etc.</dd>
<dd>Will ask an already established website like crunchyroll if we can use their database of media. In return, we link their website to the media.</dd>
</dl>
## Project Goals
<dl><dt> Learn app development</dt>
<dd>I have someone else working with me (for Apple products) but we are both extremely new.</dd>
<dd>Each week we set up a goal; e.g. have buttons work, input changes a certain text, input adds to a list, etc.</dd>
</dl>
### Database set-up
<dd>How do we store the data? Still in consideration</dd>
### Outlook/Design
<dd>Consistency with android/apple devices</dd>
<dd>Easy and efficient to use</dd>
<dd>Will draw users in</dd>
<dd>Mockups (Already have a few in mind)</dd>
### Testing
<dd>Have users download the app and use test-drive it for a few weeks.</dd>
<dd>Tweak based on recommendations/criticisms</dd>
##Technology to know
### App development
<dd>Android Studio</dd>
<dd>Eclipse</dd>
<dd>XCode</dd>
### Database
<dd>SQLite Database?</dd>
<dd>Still not sure, working on layout and the coding for front-end first</dd>
